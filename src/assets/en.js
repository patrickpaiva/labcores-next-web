  ABOUT_1: 'More than entertainment or learning, through social media, we can identify unprecedented levels of citizen engagement and participation. This activity is called “participatory sensing” or “citizen sensing”. Moreover, sensors are embedded into our everyday environment, such as cars, micro-chipped animals, elevators, smart buildings, environmental monitors and others. Many people are now carrying some form of sensor-laden device - a mobile phone, a tablet, a fitness device - from which sensor readings can also be retrieved. In this case, people interact – direct and indirect – with sensors. This is called ‘human-in-the-loop sensing’, empowering the citizen sensing with new kind of data. In citizen sensing, a sensor is not necessarily a hardware sensor, but can be a virtual sensor or a human interpreting sensory data. This data explosion has resulted in the emerging topic of “Big Social Data”. Big Social Data refers to large data volumes that relate to people interactions (with other people or things) or describe their behaviors, needs, and patterns. This data generates a cycle of knowledge creation, which can be useful to resolve problems in urban centers. From this social interaction, we can create more accurate knowledge about the city and its dynamics to support monitoring, surveillance and decision-making tasks of various kinds.',

  SENSING_MONITORING: 'Sensing and Monitoring',
  SENSING_MONITORING_1: 'Through social media, people share opinions, experiences and perspectives, which can be revealed by different formats such as text, images, audio and video. Also, we can identify unprecedented levels of citizen engagement and participation. Users can detect new events, help in dealing with natural disasters, diseases, terrorism, and understand the political scenario and support public manifestations. Citizens consume and share information about their cities - such as problems, events, ideas, suggestions, criticisms, and demands – acting as ‘human sensors’, forming opinions and participating in the city evolution. This activity is called “participatory sensing” or “citizen sensing”, a form of citizen participation in environmental monitoring and action which is bottom-up, empowering a community. ',
  SENSING_MONITORING_2: 'Moreover, sensors are embedded into our everyday environment, such as cars, micro-chipped animals, elevators, smart buildings, environmental monitors and others.

  DATA_ENGINEERING: 'Data Engineering and Semantic Treatment',
  DATA_ENGINEERING_1: 'In Big Social Data context, the massive growth of data demands new techniques to access, manage, mine, analyze, and act on data. Real-time mining of indirectly self-reported and sousveillance information harvested from social media can offer useful data and insights about unfolding trends and emerging crowd behaviors, especially at times of crises. However, such data often contain variable amounts of “noise”, misinformation and bias (which can get further “amplified” through the viral nature of social media) and usually require some advanced forms of filtering and verification by both machine-based algorithms and human experts before becoming reliable enough for use in decision-making tasks. Eradicating these issues or lessening their effect can be accomplished by verification of data with other sensor nodes, but depends on the density of the network and existence of other related data.',

  COMPUTATIONAL_ETHICS_1: 'We focus on ethics applied to the digital universe with a specific lens aimed at, but not limited to, the Brazilian context. Our investigations also have a meta-scientific bias, covering in parallel the collaborative networks between researchers and how they form, evolve and influence scientific production. We study the ethical or moral aspects and implications that emerge on digital platforms, including academic interactions. Recognizing the richness and diversity of the Brazilian scenario, we seek to ensure that research and collaboration practices in the digital environment are conducted with integrity, transparency and respect. We are dedicated to building a solid knowledge base that serves as a guide for ethical conduct in the Brazilian digital landscape, valuing and promoting best practices in our academic and research environment.',

  TOXIC_DIGITAL_CONTENT_1:'This area aims to create solutions to identify and combat the spread of harmful content on social media, such as disinformation, hate speech, misogyny, transphobia and pedophilia. Identification is done by analyzing and detecting patterns of content characteristics (syntax, semantics, subjects covered, layout, as well as feelings and emotions expressed) and context (profile characteristics, propagation, interactions about the content, etc.). Once toxic content has been identified, one of the ways to combat it is to understand the path of this information. Multi-network propagation refers to the spread of information (in this case, toxic information) through various interconnected networks such as online social networks, messaging tools, news networks, forums and other communication channels. Modeling propagation in this context can help us understand how this information spreads, how it can become viral and what factors influence its spread. We know that combating this type of content is not only done through automatic or semi-automatic techniques. That is why we have also created mechanisms to support media literacy, teaching people how to identify the characteristics of toxic content and how to combat it.',
